Mentoring session 1 notes
---
- Be careful of how we visualise total numbers - could come across as misleading "i.e. Wollongong has x amount of CO2 per day"
  - Need to show data sources (maybe as a link below?)
- Colour scale for heatmap
- Icons for POI
  - maybe places where renewable energy are generated -> green lightning bolt)
  - places with e.g. large factory-based (or industry area) energy consumption can have a red notif icon

- Pitch a peer-pressure angle (i should do better than others?) perhaps?
- Comparison between LGA areas (pressuring local government areas to do more?
- Provide an email template which they can text to their local government representative? (Drafts for them based on their postcode)
- Ensure that your data is robust (they can trust)

- MAKE SURE THE USE CASE IS FOCUSED

- Maybe have some interface for home owners to connect their power company APIS to give their actual energy consumption (i.e. gas usage??
  - Might not be able to get it to work during the hackathon, but can show mockups / prototypes to show how it works

BRAINSTORMING
- What does our product do?
  - provide visualised data to see how your community is comparing to others in terms of:
    - 
    - daily household electricity carbon emissions
    - household solar panel uptake (data column F/E)
    - household 
   
      
- Who would use our product?


- How does our product provide value to our users?
  - could aim to be a primary data point similar to Covidlive
    - posed as a community resource
    - robust (trustworthy) data 

- How do we want our users to feel when using the product?
