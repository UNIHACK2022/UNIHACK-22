Mentoring session 1 notes
-
- Be careful of how we visualise total numbers - could come across as misleading "i.e. Wollongong has x amount of CO2 per day"
  - Need to show data sources (maybe as a link below?)
- Colour scale for heatmap
- Icons for POI (maybe places where renewable energy are generated -> green lightning bolt)

- Pitch a peer-pressure angle (i should do better than others?) perhaps?
- Comparison between LGA areas (pressuring local government areas to do more?
- Provide an email template which they can text to their local government representative? (Drafts for them based on their postcode)
- Ensure that your data is robust (they can trust)

- MAKE SURE THE USE CASE IS FOCUSED

- Maybe have some interface for home owners to connect their power company APIS to give their actual energy consumption (i.e. gas usage??
  - Might not be able to get it to work during the hackathon, but can show mockups / prototypes to show how it works
